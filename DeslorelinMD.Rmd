abstract: |
  In general, males should be particularly attentive to cues of sexual availability and females should advertise accordingly. Vaginal patency (i.e., the openness of the vagina) is a reliable indicator of sexual maturity; if the vagina is closed, the female is unable to copulate. The southern giant pouched rat (*Cricetomys ansorgei*) is unusual because females can have fully fused vaginal openings (i.e., vaginal nonpatency) despite being considered ‘adults’ by other metrics. Moreover, some females reversibly close their vaginal openings. Thus, vaginal patency in the pouched rat is a ‘flexible’ reproductive state. We subcutaneously implanted a long-acting GnRH agonist (deslorelin), which over time inhibits sex steroid secretion, to better understand the endocrinology and social behavior relating to vaginal patency in this species. We hypothesized that altering GnRH would impact both patency and behavior through its effects on circulating levels of estradiol. Six months of deslorelin treatment did not alter vaginal patency. Behaviorally, deslorelin-treated females spent less time interacting with, and were more aggressive towards males (compared to controls). Notably, deslorelin did not alter female scent marking. We conclude that behavioral receptivity, but not vaginal patency, is impacted by GnRH hormonal cascades in the pouched rat.

# Introduction

For successful reproduction, animals must be fertile, sexually receptive, and find an appropriate mate. Animals often advertise their fertility and receptivity through signals to combat the barriers to successful reproduction. These can include odors [@ferkinOdorCommunicationMate2018; @johnstonChemicalCommunicationRodents2003], vocalizations [@ronaldMaleMiceAdjust2020], and behaviors [@zipsePacedMatingBehavior2000]. Odors that persist in the environment (e.g., scent marks) are a particularly salient method of advertising presence, identity, and reproductive status for nocturnal rodents [@ferkinOdorCommunicationMate2018; @ferkinOdorPreferenceSocial2011; @drickamerOestrousFemaleHouse1992; @carrResponsesMaleRats1980; @freemanAnogenitalDistancePredicts2019]. 

The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, and its associated hormones, is a critical mediator of reproductive status and maturity, and is responsible for the onset of puberty [@hanActivationGonadotropinReleasingHormone2005; @uenoyamaCentralMechanismControlling2019] and the reproductive cycling that is common among mammals [@christianNeurobiologyPreovulatoryEstradiolInduced2010]. Accordingly, changes in this axis can result in altered reproductive maturation, fertility, and cycling [@rivierInfluenceCorticotropinreleasingFactor1984; @peragineRFamiderelatedPeptide3RFRP32017; @bottcherImpactOpioidSystem2017; @grossetContraceptiveEffectPotential2012]. One milestone of reproductive maturation for female rodents is vaginal introitus or patency, whereby the vagina develops an external opening [@whitsettPhotoperiodReproductionFemale1982; @millerLongerLifeSpans2002]. This development usually coincides with weaning from the female's mother and the onset of first estrus, and is associated with an increase in gonadal steroid production [@whitsettPhotoperiodReproductionFemale1982]. In some species, females can become nonpatent in the winter or non-breeding season when sex steroid concentrations are low. For both deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) and Siberian hamsters (_Phodopus sungorous_), patency is dependent on photoperiod, indicating patency can change with breeding seasons and the associated changes in sex steroids [@whitsettPhotoperiodReproductionFemale1982; @placeShortDayLengths2004]. Notably, treatment with estradiol during periods of short daylength can induce the uterine horns to increase in mass, and cause female Siberian hamsters to become patent [@placeShortDayLengths2004].

However, in the southern giant pouched rat (_Cricetomys ansorgei_) patency onset can be delayed well into adulthood and females can revert from vaginally-patent adults to a nonpatent state [@freemanAnogenitalDistancePredicts2019]. Because females who are nonpatent cannot mate, males would have a reproductive advantage if they are able to detect patency though cues or signals. Indeed, males can discriminate between patent and nonpatent females based on odor alone [@freemanAnogenitalDistancePredicts2019]. Similarly, patent females discriminate between 'competitive' and 'non-competitive' males; this is a discrimination advantage that nonpatent females do not demonstrate [@freemanAnogenitalDistancePredicts2019].

Deslorelin, a long-acting gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, is used in many species as a form of contraception to induce a pseudo-menopausal state [@grossetContraceptiveEffectPotential2012; @munsonEfficacyGnRHAnalogue2001; @vanzeelandUseGnRHAgonist2014]. Deslorelin binds to GnRH receptors located in the anterior pituitary and initially induces an increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) release (i.e., a 'flare-up' period) [@geyerReversibleEstrousCycle2016]. LH and FSH secretion then stimulate the gonads to release sex steroid hormones (progesterone and estrogens for females). However, with prolonged activity, the GnRH agonist will desensitize the anterior pituitary and induce negative feedback that eventually reduces sex steriod production in the ovaries [@grossetContraceptiveEffectPotential2012; @munsonEfficacyGnRHAnalogue2001]. Thus, deslorelin serves as a powerful tool to manipulate the natural endogenous release of estradiol.

Given the role that sex steroids and the HPG axis play in patency in other rodents, we predicted that deslorelin would reduce estradiol over the long term through its negative feedback actions resulting from GnRH agonism, which would in turn induce nonpatency in female pouched rats. We also predicted that manipulation of GnRH would impact female advertisement and sexual receptivity behavior. To test these predictions we implanted females with deslorelin or a vehicle implant. We monitored patency over 6 months in these females and conducted two behavioral assays. First, we examined how females scent mark in response to male urine. We examined scent marking before implantation, 2 weeks after implantation (i.e., the expected 'flare-up' period), and at 6 weeks post-implantation. We predicted that deslorelin-treated females would have increased scent marking behavior at week 2 compared to control females, and that scent marking would decrease to baseline or below baseline-levels at week 6. Secondly, we assessed how males responded to deslorelin and control females in a 3-chamber social interaction test to determine if males can discriminate between these females. We expected that males would prefer to interact with control females over deslorelin-treated females because deslorelin would impair cycling. Finally, we used this social interaction test to determine how deslorelin and control females responded to male social interaction. We predicted that control females would spend more time in the area closest to the male compared to deslorelin-treated females, and would exhibit more sniffing and fewer aggressive behaviors towards males.

# Methods

## Animals
 The animals used in this study included animals captured at our field site in Morogoro, Tanzania as adults, and their descendants that were born in our captive colony.

We used 16 females for deslorelin (or vehicle) implantation and scent marking behavior testing. We conducted baseline scent marking experiments (prior to deslorlelin or vehicle implantation, see below) on 13 of these patent females. Nine females were wild-caught adults of unknown age, and the other 7 females were born in captivity as descendants from wild-caught pouched rats. Captive-born animals were weaned from their mothers after 2 months and were housed with same-sex siblings (when available) in the colony room for up to 2 additional months. Young pouched rats were then housed individually. All the adult animals were housed singly in standard rabbit cages (61 x 61 x 41 cm; Hoeltge Inc., Cincinnati, OH, U.S.A.), with males and females in separate rooms. Shredded newspaper was used as bedding in each cage. The colony followed a 12:12 h light:dark cycle (lights off at 1400 hours Eastern Daylight Time, EDT) and was maintained at 21°C and 45% humidity. The animals were fed Teklad F6 rodent diet (Envigo, Huntingdon, U.K.), provided water ad libitum, and given weekly treats of fruits, vegetables, or seeds. All of the work detailed here was approved by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO) and the Cornell Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
 
## Implantation
16 adult females were briefly anesthetized using isoflurane gas and then implanted with either a deslorelin implant (n = 8, Virbac Ltd, Westlake, TX) or vehicle implant (n = 8, Virbac Ltd, Westlake, TX) placed subcutaneously on the dorsal side of the animal, just caudal to the shoulder blades and near the midline as recommended by the manufacturer. All females were patent at the start of the experiment, except one that had reverted to nonpatency one week prior to implantation. This female was included in our dataset, because she became patent again shortly after implantation. Animals were separated into two groups of 8 (4 deslorelin and 4 control in each group) and the second group received implants 7 weeks after the first due to practical considerations. The day of implantation was defined as 'day 0' (Figure 1) for each group.

## Physical examination

We closely monitored vaginal patency of the female African giant pouched rats on a weekly basis with visual inspection assisted by a periodontal probe when the female was under isofluorane anesthesia. We scored the measurements as either nonpatent (i.e., fused, with no opening in the skin), patent closed (i.e., unfused, with partial opening in the skin), or patent (i.e., unfused, with opening in the skin). While females were anesthetized, we also weighed the rats and recorded nipple size. Nipple size was measured using a wire gauge measuring tool that included numerical measurements with decreasing diameter indicated by larger numbers. Nipple size was included as an additional measure of reproductive state. 

## Urine Collection
Adult male urine was collected prior to the start of female experiments for use in scent marking behavior experiments. Urine was collected by placing aluminum trays underneath individual male cages.We aliquoted the collected urine using a clean pipette into 1mL samples within 2 h of deposition in the tray. The samples were immediately frozen at -20°C. To eliminate potential female preferences for specific males, we thawed then mixed urine from 13 males for the first group of females, and 10 males for the second group of females to create a homogenous stock for scent marking trials. These mixtures were frozen in aliquots until use on the day of the trial.

## Behavior

### Scent marking

Scent marking testing was conducted prior to implantation (n = 13 females), and during weeks 2 and 6 (n = 16 females) of the experiment in a separate behavior testing room. All scent marking experiments were conducted during the dark phase (after 1400 EDT). We pipetted 200 µL of the male urine mix into an outlined circle (3.8 cm diameter) on a piece of white printer paper. The printer paper was taped to lab bench paper (Benchkote) cut to the area of a large dog kennel (35 x 77.5 x 58.5 cm; MidWest Pet Products Inc., Irvine, CA, U.S.A.). We waited 5-10 minutes after application before introducing the female to ensure that the urine saturated the paper, but had not yet dried. To move the individual rats from the colony to the behavior room, each rat was ushered into their ‘stovepipe’ carrier (see @freemanAnogenitalDistancePredicts2019 for detailed description) and placed in a standard rat cage with an isolator lid. The same method was used to return each rat after each trial. Females were placed into the kennel and were video-recorded for fifteen minutes for later behavioral scoring. The dog kennel and floor were wiped down using 70% ethanol before each trial. After each trial, a UV light was used to identify urine and chew marks on the paper, which were outlined with a pencil. We scored the videos for the time females groomed themselves, sniffed the urine mixture, licked the urine mixture, cheek marked, urine marked, and engaged in anogenital rubbing. A female was defined as sniffing the urine mixture if her nose was approximately 2 cm or less from the urine mixture. We defined licking as the direct contact of the subject’s tongue with the male urine stimulus on the paper. We calculated an investigation score as a sum of the total time sniffing and licking the urine mixture. Cheek marking was defined as the pouched rat rubbing its cheek on the paper. Urine marking was defined as the animal depositing urine. We analyzed the urine-marked paper to measure the number of and total area of each scent mark.

### Male Choice

knitr::include_graphics("social reactivity diagram - interaction zones.pdf")
```

Male choice tests were conducted when females were approximately 6 months post-implantation. All choice tests were conducted in the behavioral testing room during the dark phase. Three wire-chambers (dog kennels as above, modified) were set up side by side in the behavioral testing room. Two females (one deslorelin-implanted, one vehicle-implanted) were placed individually on the two chambers on each end (Figure 2). The male was placed in the center, double-wide chamber. At the start of each trial, a black plexiglas barrier separated pouched rats from being able to contact or see one another. The pouched rats were given 15 minutes to acclimate to the chambers, after which the barriers were removed and the trial began. All trials lasted 30min and were recorded for later analysis. Animals could have limited contact through wire caging, but were kept separated for safety of the animals. After each trial the females and the male were returned to their home cages in single-sex colony rooms, and the arena and floor were thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol. Each male was tested once, and females were used as stimuli no more than once per week. Stimuli were selected to ensure that each female was presented in similar frequencies when repeated across trials, each female was presented on each side at similar frequencies (in case the female had a side bias within her enclosure), and each side had equal representation of control and experimental females (in case males had a side bias).

We summed the duration that the male spent in each 'interaction zone' (Figure 2), which comprised approximately the last 23cm (length) of the middle chamber that abutted each female side chamber. This size was chosen because the second horizontal wire of the kennel (marking the end of the zone) was visible on video, and this length is approximately one pouched rat body length. We also summed the duration of time females spent in the corresponding interaction zone in the female chambers. Animals were considered to be in the interaction zone when three paws had crossed into the zone. We also calculated the duration each animal spent rearing (front two paws off the ground), grooming (foot contact or mouth contact with its own pelage or tail), sniffing (nose within approx. 2.5cm of another animal's body or tail), biting (behaviors where the subject's mouth contacts another animal's body or tail), swatting (when animals move front paws up and down when facing another animal, similar to boxing), or lunging (behaviors where mouth or feet contact another animal's body or tail while the subject is moving forward), climbing (all limbs off the ground), and scent marking (subject rubs its face or anogenital region on a substrate). 

Because some animals might be more or less willing to enter the interaction zone, and this could impact opportunities for aggressive or investigative behavior, we calculated the time that each male and female shared in the interaction zone together, and used this to calculate percentages of time that animals spent interacting aggressively (biting, swatting, lunging) or engaging in investigative behavior (sniffing).

We used these data to determine whether males showed differential behavior towards deslorelin and control females. We also used these data to determine how deslorelin and control females differed in their interactions with males.

## Statistical Analysis

### Scent mark data
We used repeated measures ANOVAs to compare scent marking behavior (specifically behavior duration and scent mark area) between treatment groups across the 3 timepoints (Baseline, week 2, and week 6). For count data, we used a generalized linear mixed model with a negative binomial distribution and animal ID as a random effect. For both of these models, post-hoc contrasts were conducted using estimated marginal means. A t-test was used to determine the statistical significance of the change in mass and nipple gauge (from baseline to week 2) between the experimental treatment group (i.e., deslorelin implant) and control group (i.e., vehicle implant).

### Mate choice data 
We used a linear mixed model to test how the fixed effects of treatment (deslorelin or vehicle) and sex (male or female) impacted aggressive behavior proportions during time in the 'interaction zone'. We used a second linear mixed model to test how the fixed effects of treatment (deslorelin or vehicle) and sex (male or female) impacted sniffing behavior proportions during time in the 'interaction zone'. Trial was included as a random effect in both models. Significant effects were followed by pairwise post-hoc tests. For all mixed models, we used Q-Q plots of residuals to assess normality and ensure models did not violate assumptions.

### Software
Behaviors were scored using BORIS [@friardBORISFreeVersatile2016]. Scent mark number and area were calculated using ImageJ [@schneiderNIHImageImageJ2012]. All statistical analyses were conducted using R 4.1.2 [@rdevelopmentcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2016]. Packages used included: lme4 [@batesFittingLinearMixedeffects2015] and emmeans [@lenthEmmeansEstimatedMarginal2018] for statistical analysis and ggplot [@wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016] and cowplot  [@wilkeCowplotStreamlinedPlot2020] for graphing. All annotated data and R scripts are available at the Open Science Framework (XXXXX).

## Vaginal Patency, Mass, and Nipple Size
There were no changes in vaginal patency after physical examination of the animals over 6 months. At 6 weeks, none of the deslorelin-treated females were nonpatent and all remained patent for the rest of the study. The deslorelin-treated previously nonpatent female became patent by week 2 and remained patent. Specifically, the deslorelin-treated females did not differ from control females in terms of nipple size change between baseline and week 2 when estradiol was expected to be high (t~`r round(Nipresult$parameter, digits= 2)`~ = `r round(Nipresult$statistic, digits= 3)`, p = `r round(Nipresult$p.value, digits= 4)`; mean change ± SE, control = `r round(mean(SalineNip$diffnip), digits = 3)` ± `r round(serr(SalineNip$diffnip), digits =3)` AWG, deslorelin = `r round(mean(DeslorNip$diffnip), digits = 3)` ± `r round(serr(DeslorNip$diffnip), digits = 3)` AWG).

We detected no effect of treatment or timepoint on the investigation of stimulus scent marks by females, which included licking, sniffing, and scratching the mark. We detected no effect of treatment or trial on the total number of urine marks, or on the total area of urine marks (Table 1, Figure 3).

Overall, males did not differ in how much time they spent in the 'interaction zone' irrespective of the females' location (Supplementary Figure 1; F~(1,32)~ = `r round(InteractingAnovaSupp1$'F value'[1], digits =3)`, p = `r round(InteractingAnovaSupp1$'Pr(>F)'[1], digits= 4)`). Similarly, deslorelin and control females did not significantly differ in how much time they spent in the 'interaction zone' irrespective of male behavior (Supplementary Figure 2; F~(1,32)~ = `r round(InteractingAnovaSupp2$'F value'[1], digits =3)`, p = `r round(InteractingAnovaSupp2$'Pr(>F)'[1], digits= 4)`).** However, deslorelin treatment significantly impacted the ways the females and males interacted behaviorally. We found that males and control females spent significantly more time interacting (i.e., both individuals in the 'interaction zone' at the same time) compared to males and deslorelin-implanted females (t~`r round(fit1a$coefficients[2,3], digits= 3)`~ = `r round(fit1a$coefficients[2,4], digits= 3)`, p = `r round(fit1a$coefficients[2,5], digits= 4)`; Figure 4).

Both males and females spent a larger proportion of the time spent interacting being aggressive when the female had a deslorelin implant (Figure 5). We found a main effect of female implant type on aggression (F~(1,48)~: `r round(agg.aov$'F value'[1], digits= 2)`, p = `r round(agg.aov$'Pr(>F)'[1], digits= 5)`), but no main effect of sex (F~(1,48)~: `r round(agg.aov$'F value'[2], digits= 2)`, p = `r round(agg.aov$'Pr(>F)'[2], digits= 4)`), or interaction of implant type and sex (F~(1,48)~: `r round(agg.aov$'F value'[3], digits= 2)`, p = `r round(agg.aov$'Pr(>F)'[3], digits= 4)`).

As a proportion of the interacting time, both males and females spent more time sniffing when the female had a deslorelin implant (Figure 6). We detected a main effect of female implant type on sniffing (F~(1,48)~: `r round(sniff.aov$'F value'[1], digits= 2)`, p = `r round(sniff.aov$'Pr(>F)'[1], digits= 4)`), but no effect of sex (F~(1,48)~: `r round(sniff.aov$'F value'[2], digits= 2)`, p = `r round(sniff.aov$'Pr(>F)'[2], digits= 4)`), and no interaction between sex and implant type (F~(1,48)~: `r round(sniff.aov$'F value'[3], digits= 2)`, p = `r round(sniff.aov$'Pr(>F)'[3], digits= 4)`).

To separate sniffing associated with aggression from sniffing in a non-aggressive context, we additionally examined if the proportion of sniffing without simultaneous aggression differed between deslorelin-treated females and males and control females and males (Figure 7). Similarly, we detected a main effect of implant type (F~(1,48)~= `r round(sniffNA.aov$'F value'[1], digits= 2)`, p = `r round(sniffNA.aov$'Pr(>F)'[1], digits= 4)`), but no effect of sex (F~(1,48)~= `r round(sniffNA.aov$'F value'[2], digits= 2)`, p = `r round(sniffNA.aov$'Pr(>F)'[2], digits= 4)`) and no interaction (F~(1,48)~= `r round(sniffNA.aov$'F value'[3], digits= 2)`, p = `r round(sniffNA.aov$'Pr(>F)'[3], digits= 4)`). A pairwise post-hoc test of these data revealed that males significantly differed in their non-aggressive sniffing of deslorelin and control females (t~(48)~ = 2.094, p = 0.042), though females did not (t~(48)~ = 0.947, p = 0.349).

# Discussion

Vaginal patency is an important indicator of sexual maturity, and we investigated the
mechanistic role GnRH plays in female southern giant pouched rat patency, female scent marking, and sexual receptivity behavior. We also investigated how a long-lasting GnRH agonist implant in females impacts male mate choice of those females. After monitoring patency changes in female pouched rats for 6 months, we observed no changes in patency associated with deslorelin implantation. There was no statistically significant difference in nipple size or mass change between baseline and week 2 after implantation between deslorelin-treated and control females. Similarly, we detected no difference in female scent marking behavior. Female behavior towards a live male, however, was significantly impacted by deslorelin implantation. Male behavioral responses to females was also significantly impacted by whether the female received a deslorelin implant.

_Patency_

In other species, female sexual receptivity and genital morphology is mediated by estradiol. In ovariectomized rats, decreased estrogen levels resulted in vaginal atrophy and the replacement of estrogen diminished this effect [@bermanEffectEstrogenWithdrawal1998]. Research using Siberian hamsters demonstrated a link between estradiol levels and developing patency; increased estradiol also resulted in larger uterine horns [@placeShortDayLengths2004]. There are some plausible explanations for why we did not see any changes in patency as a result of our long-acting GnRH agonist. One possible explanation is that the deslorelin implants unintentionally induced pseudopregnancy, which would disrupt our hypothesized mechanistic pathway after implantation (Place and Molina, pers. communication). Acute GnRH administration can induce pseudopregnancy [@geyerReversibleEstrousCycle2016], although long-term agonists suppress cyclicity. Given that the gestation period of pouched rats is approximately 28-32 days (@ajayiGiantRatsMeat1974), the possibility of a pseudopregnancy preventing vaginal closure for the entire 6-month period that we monitored is unlikely. We do not currently have measures of the reproductive organs of these pouched rats after deslorelin implantation, which would reveal if the uterine horns reduced in size over time with deslorelin [@placeShortDayLengths2004; @toydemirEffectsGnRHAnalogue2012]. However, previous imaging in this species indicated that nonpatent females have smaller uterine horns compared to patent females [@freemanOpenItAfrican2021, in prep.].

Alternatively, it is possible that patency changes are not affected by, or are less affected by, changes in GnRH. In female guinea pigs (_Cavia porcellus_), deslorelin administration was ineffective at reducing estradiol, and resulted in longer and more erratic periods of vaginal patency [@kohutovaEffectDeslorelinAcetate2015]. Deslorelin also appears to be ineffective in male guinea pigs, and does not significantly decrease circulating testosterone [@glocovaEffectGnRHAgonist2020a]. Other neuroendocrine factors can impact the HPG axis and reproductive maturation. For example, in naked mole rats (_Heterocephalus glaber_), the onset of puberty is controlled by RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3), and its activity on central GnRH neurons inhibits reproduction [@peragineRFamiderelatedPeptide3RFRP32017]. Similarly, the kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus have a role in the onset of puberty [@uenoyamaCentralMechanismControlling2019]. Research into how these pathways might impact patency in pouched rats will shed light on the hormonal control of reproduction in this species. Our data lead us to conclude that estradiol changes by way of GnRH-induced negative feedback on the HPG axis is unlikely to be responsible for shifting females from patency to nonpatency. Thus, it remains unclear how, and by which mechanisms, patency is controlled in female pouched rats.

 
_Scent marking_

We did not observe any significant difference in scent marking behavior between the treatment groups or across time. We had predicted that during the early 'flare-up' of estradiol that is associated with deslorelin administration [@geyerReversibleEstrousCycle2016], females would advertise via scent marking due to increasing gonadal steroids. We also predicted that this would decrease to baseline or below baseline levels at week 6, similar to effects seen in domestic cat and dog marking behavior [@geyerReversibleEstrousCycle2016]. However, to our surprise, deslorelin did not impact scent marking behavior. 

In female rats (_Rattus spp._) and hamsters (_Mesocricetus auratus_), scent marking behavior increases in the periovulatory part of the estrous cycle [@birkeScentmarkingOestrousCycle1978; @johnstonCausationTwoScentmarking1977], suggesting that females in these species might use specific marks to attract mates. However, the reproductive state of female prairie voles does not significantly affect scent marking, and females will mark at any point during the estrous cycle, with marks serving as a form of self-identification [@wolffScentMarkingFemale2002]. Therefore, it is possible that pouched rat females are more similar to prairie voles in this way and might mark as a form of self-identification. It is also possible that the stimuli type affected the likelihood for females to mark. Female hamsters  demonstrate different scent marking behaviors when presented with male or female stimuli [@johnstonCausationTwoScentmarking1977]. As a result, exposure to a mixture of male urine might have yielded similar results due to the stimulus itself. If females use scent marking as a broad identity signal, then they should also scent mark to female stimuli independent of estrous cycle. However, this hypothesis will need to be directly tested.

_Male Choice_

Males spent more time interacting with vehicle-treated females than with deslorelin-treated females, matching our predictions that males will preferentially interact with sexually receptive females. This prediction was based on the assumption that males should seek out fertile, receptive females for mating, and that long-term treatment with GnRH would impair fertility and cycling. Indeed, males spent more time interacting with these vehicle-treated, presumably fertile, females. This preference appears to not be influenced by motivation to interact, _per se_, because males did not differ in time adjacent to either females' enclosure. To explore the behavior of males and females during these interactions more closely, we examined the role of treatment on the proportion of time spent sniffing and engaging in aggressive behaviors (i.e., lunging, biting, and swatting). As predicted, males spent more time engaging in aggressive behaviors with females that were treated with deslorelin. Similarly, females treated with deslorelin also engaged in more aggressive behaviors towards males compared to control females. It is unclear if females are aggressive and males respond, or if both individuals are engaging in aggression simultaneously due to some other cue or signal. Males and deslorelin-treated females also spent a larger proportion of interaction time sniffing one another. These nose-to-nose (most commonly observed) and nose-to-body behaviors often preceded aggression when females were treated with deslorelin. Accordingly, we separated sniffing during all interactions from sniffing that occurred during aggression. We determined that females did not appear to differ in their non-aggressive sniffing behaviors, however, males differed in their non-aggressive sniffing between deslorelin and control females and spent more time sniffing deslorelin females. Males might spend more time sniffing to detect or process olfactory information from deslorelin females compared to control females, leading to increased sniffing time.

Females that received vehicle implants spent approximately 25% of the time they interacted with males sniffing them. These control females rarely exhibited aggression towards the male, and likewise, male aggression towards vehicle-implanted females was extremely rare. Indeed, there were relatively few occurences of sniffing or fighting while males and control females were in the 'interaction' zone together. In contrast, most of the interactions within these dyads consisted of grooming, climbing, rearing, walking, and standing still.

Male pouched rats can detect female patency through odor alone, and prefer to associate with odors from patent females [@freemanAnogenitalDistancePredicts2019]. In addition to being able to detect patency, we have demonstrated that males can also detect differences in females that were implanted with a GnRH agonist from those that received a vehicle implant. These results suggest that males can detect differences in female behavior, or odor, or some other factor that resulted from altered GnRH. Whatever the mechanisms, the consequence is that males spent more time investigating control, presumably fertile, females. The ability to detect mate quality including fertility has been studied in other rodents [@goslingScentmarkingMaleMammals2001; @birkeScentmarkingOestrousCycle1978; @johnstonCausationTwoScentmarking1977; @coombesFemaleChemicalSignalling2018; @hurstScentWarsChemobiology2004; @thonhauserScentMarkingIncreases2013]. However, because female pouched rats can be patent and non-cycling, both of which are necessary for successful reproduction, males might benefit from the ability to independently detect both patency and fertility.

_Conclusion_

Administration of a long-term GnRH agonist impacts behavior, but not external reproductive morphology (i.e., vaginal patency) in female pouched rats. We conclude that changes in circulating estradiol are not solely responsible for changing patency in this species, and additional, as yet, unknown mechanisms are involved. We did not detect differences in female scent marking behavior following deslorelin treatment, yet we did find differences in female sexual receptivity. Deslorelin-treated females were less receptive to males, and were significantly more aggressive towards males compared to control females. We also detected differences in how males perceived females that received deslorelin treatment. Males spent less time interacting with deslorelin-treated females, and were more aggressive during those interactions, compared to interactions with controls. Whether males are detecting differences in odor, behavior, or some other cue is unknown. However, males show behavioral differences towards receptive versus non-receptive patent females, which would presumably be advantageous for mate choice in this species.
